<h4>Operations</h4>
The traffic operation research at UTEP has been expanding and advancing by cooperating with transportation agencies like the Texas Department of Transportation and El Paso Metropolitan Planning Organization. The transportation laboratory is equipped with state-of-the-art simulation/traffic analysis software such as CORSIM, VISSIM, PARAMICS and Synchro/SimTraffic for modeling of traffic operations. Examples of these research activities include:<br/><br/>
                  <strong><em>Traffic Management at Port of Entry:</em></strong>Researchers at UTEP has developed microscopic traffic simulation models for the ports of entry in the El Paso area, and use them to evaluate the bi-directional traffic management strategies at the international bridges, inspection areas and the surrounding neighborhoods.<br/><br/>
                  <strong><em>Roundabout Capacity &amp; Operations:</em></strong>UTEP is conducting research on the effect of unbalanced traffic volume, pedestrian and adjacent signalized intersections on roundabout operations.<br/><br/>
                  <strong><em>Diverging Diamond Interchange:</em></strong> Diverging diamond interchange is a new type of interchange that has a potential to replace the traditional diamond interchange and with a significant reduction in traffic delay. UTEP researchers are performing the signal design and simulation evaluation of diverging diamond interchange that has a significant through traffic volume on frontage roads. <br/><br/>
                  <strong><em>Freeway Operations Related to Geometric Design:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em> UTEP has engaged in several research efforts to manage freeway ramps, including the comparative evaluation of ramp metering algorithms.&nbsp; UTEP researchers are currently working on the following project:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Design and Scope of the Impact of Auxiliary Lanes, <u>TxDOT.</u></li>
                  </ul>
                  <strong><em>Freeway Work Zone Traffic Management</em></strong><em>:&nbsp;</em> UTEP&rsquo;s research in this area focuses on the integrated corridor management (ICM) concept; attempting to capture the traffic diversion and re-distribution of traffic flow due to freeway work zones.<br/><br/>
              UTEP researchers have worked with researchers at Texas Transportation Institute on the following research projects in traffic operations:
              <ul>
                <li>Feasibility and Guidelines for Applying Managed Lane Strategies to Ramps, <u>TxDOT</u>.</li>
                <li>Ramp Treatment and Dynamic Closure Strategies for Incident Traffic Management, <u>TxDOT</u>. </li>
                <li>Improved Techniques for Traffic Control for Freeways and Work Zones, <u>TxDOT</u>.</li>
              </ul>
