CTIS has an extensive background in the area of bridge deck assessment particularly in early-stage deterioration detection through material degradation or defect initiation. The researchers at CTIS have combined the Ultrasonic seismic techniques, in particular the impact echo (IE) technique, and electromagnetic testing by ground penetrating radar (GPR) for this purpose UTEP is equipped with testing equipment and expertise to conduct both seismic and GPR tests. Researchers at UTEP use a recently developed software package, RoadDoctor® by RoadScanners, which provides a platform for integration of seismic and GPR data, GPS (Ground Positioning System) coordinates, video frames and images taken during the bridge survey.<br/><br/>
              Examples of equipment available include:
              <ul>
                <li>Portable Seismic Property Analyzer (PSPA)</li>
                <li>A complete multi-channel GPR data acquisition system (GSSI SIR-20) and a number of ground-coupled and air-coupled antennas </li>
              </ul>
              To overcome the slow process of testing and the necessity of lane closure for ultrasonic testing, UTEP is in the process of developing an automatic scanner for faster data collection. This computer-controlled system can be effectively used for fast data collection on bridge decks as well as approach slabs and other structures.<br/><br/>
              UTEP also has extensive background in the development and application of large area non-destructive evaluation (NDE) and testing of structures for the detection of flaws (i.e., cracks, loose bolts and rivets, etc.). The techniques used include vibrational/modal based data collection and data processing with classical strain energy measures and the more sophisticated artificial intelligence and statistical/probabilistic methods. Researchers at UTEP have also developed data fusion techniques to take advantage of the strengths of different NDE techniques to enhance the probability of detection of flaws.<br/><br/>
              To conduct this type of research UTEP has the following main equipment:
              <ul>
                <li>Data acquisition system with 32 accelerometer channels and 8 strain-gauge channels</li>
                <li>Several signal generators and oscilloscopes.</li>
                <li>Shakers with different load capacity</li>
                <li>Accelerometers and load transducers</li>
              </ul>
