<h4>Transportation</h4>
UTEP has a long history of collaboration with the El Paso Metropolitan Planning Organization and Texas Department of Transportation El Paso District in transportation planning research.  The transportation planning research focuses on the application of collaborative supply chain and logistics, dynamic traffic assignment, development of a bi-national transportation planning model, bus rapid transit corridor planning and use of visualization techniques in the planning process.  The laboratory is equipped with planning software such as TransCAD, VISUM and DynaSmart-P/Dynus-T to assist in modeling work.  Examples of projects in the planning area include:
              
              <ul>
                <li>Comprehensive Planning and Design Guidelines for Incorporating a Bus Rapid Transit Scenario to the Analysis of Texas Highway Corridors, TxDOT.</li>
                <li>Effectiveness of Visualization to Improve Public Participation in Transportation Planning, Federal Highway Administration.</li>
                <li>Strategies for Improving Travel Time Reliability, TxDOT.</li>
                <li>Highway Planning and Operations for El Paso District: Alameda and Paisano Interchange, TxDOT.</li>
                <li>Collaborative green supply chain and feed stock logistic systems, US Department of Agriculture </li>
